Runegraft converts user input into typed Python objects automatically. Route placeholders and option annotations describe what the user should pass and ensure the CLI fails fast with helpful errors.

## Built-in converters

You can reference these in route patterns (e.g., `<url:url>`) or via type hints:

- `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
- `url` for HTTP/HTTPS URLs
- `uuid` for UUID strings
- `json` for JSON objects/arrays (parsed into Python types)

## Custom converters

Define your own converter when you need stricter rules or domain-specific validation:

```python
from runegraft import CLI, opt, ConverterError

cli = CLI("demo")

def port(value: str) -> int:
    try:
        parsed = int(value)
    except ValueError as exc:
        raise ConverterError("Port must be an integer") from exc
    if not (1 <= parsed <= 65535):
        raise ConverterError("Port must be between 1 and 65535")
    return parsed

@cli.command("serve <port:port>")
def serve(
    port: int,
    host: str = opt("--host", default="127.0.0.1"),
):
    print(f"Serving on {host}:{port}")
```

Attach your converter to a placeholder (`<port:port>`) and annotate the parameter to keep type checkers happy.

## Validation experience

- Errors surface before your function runs, with messages that include the expected type.
- Help text shows converter names so users know what each argument expects.
- Combine converters with [Options & Flags](/concepts/options) to accept structured input everywhere.
