Runegraft bundles a prompt_toolkit shell so you can experiment with commands before wiring them into scripts. Launch it with `python -m runegraft` (or call `CLI.shell()` from your own app) and you'll see a prompt such as `runegraft>`.

## Completion & validation

- **Fuzzy tab completion**: type `sp` and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to match `spinner`; flags and short options are suggested after the command name.
- **Autosuggestions**: past input surfaces inline hints (fish shell style) that you can accept with the right arrow key.
- **Live validation**: Runegraft parses arguments as you type. You'll see inline error messages when a required arg is missing or an option value has the wrong type.

```text
runegraft> add 2
Missing required args: b
```

## Persistent history

Command history lives under `~/.runegraft/history/<cli-name>.txt`, so each CLI gets its own timeline. Run `history show` in the shell to display the latest entries or `history clear` to truncate the file.

## Built-in helpers

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `help` / `?` | Print the structured help table (same output as `CLI.print_help`). |
| `exit`, `quit`, `q` | Leave the shell. |
| `clear` | Clear the terminal without leaving the session (`Ctrl+L` works too). |
| `alias` | Manage simple aliases (`alias set ll "list --long"`). |
| `history` | Show or clear recorded commands. |
| `!` | Run the rest of the line as a system command without leaving the shell. |

## Aliases

Aliases let you map short names to longer command strings. Because alias expansion only touches the first token, options remain intact:

```text
runegraft> alias set s spinner 0.5
Alias set: s -> spinner 0.5
runegraft> s
```

They live in-memory for the current session, so add your favorites in project-specific helper scripts if you want persistence.

## Embedding the shell

When you call `CLI(shell_name).shell()` inside your own program, the class automatically constructs the history path, prompt text, and completer tree from registered commands. No additional configuration is necessary unless you want to subclass `Shell` for deeper customization.
