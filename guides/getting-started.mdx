Runegraft ships as a lightweight Python package that you run directly with `python -m runegraft`. The project root already contains a working demo CLI so you can see its features before building your own commands.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://example.invalid/runegraft.git
cd runegraft
uv sync  # or: python -m pip install -e .
```

The `uv` step installs both runtime and dev dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`. If you skip editable mode, tweak commands with `python -m pip install .`.

## Running the demo CLI

```bash
python -m runegraft
```

This launches the interactive shell with fuzzy completion, autosuggestions, and persistent history. Try a few commands:

```text
runegraft> help
runegraft> add 2 5
runegraft> echo "hi there" --upper
runegraft> spinner 1.5
```

The same commands run outside the shell via `python -m runegraft <command> ...` when you want automation-friendly invocations.

## Project layout

```
src/runegraft/
├── __main__.py   # wires the demo CLI together
├── cli.py        # core CLI object, decorator, parsing
├── parser.py     # route parsing + option inspection
├── shell.py      # prompt_toolkit-powered REPL
├── builtins.py   # aliases, history helpers
└── types.py      # built-in converters (int, url, json…)
```

Your own CLIs typically live next to `__main__.py`. You can copy `build_demo_cli()` into another module, register your commands, and keep the rest of the framework untouched.

## Next steps

- Head over to [The Interactive Shell](../guides/interactive-shell.mdx) for shortcuts, history management, and alias tips.
- When you're ready to add commands, read the [CLI API reference](../reference/cli-api.mdx) and [Routing & Types guide](../reference/routing-and-types.mdx).
